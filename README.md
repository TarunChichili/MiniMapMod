# MiniMapMod

### Steps To Run
* In The Gradle Tab (On The Right), Reimport The Gradle Project
    * This May Error - Don't Worry If It Does as It Seems To Do The Important Things Before Failing
* Then Run gradlew.bat (Which Shouldn't Error)

* Now Before Runing The Client, You Must Generate It, In The Gradle Menu (MiniMapMod > Tasks > fg_runs > genIntellijRuns) And Run The genIntellijRuns File 

* Now Go To The Configurations and Select and Run "runClient"
* Assuming Everything Went Well, Minecraft Should Start
