# MiniMapMod

### Steps To Run
* In The Gradle Tab (On The Right), Reimport The Gradle Project
    * This May Error - Don't Worry If It Does as It Seems To Do The Important Things Before Failing
* Then Run gradlew.bat (Which Shouldn't Error)
* Now Go To The Configurations and Select and Run "runClient" 
    * If There Is An Error, Edit The Configurations and In The runClient Config Set the Classpath Of The Module To MiniMapMod.test 
* Now Minecraft Should Start When You Run runClient
